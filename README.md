This advanced parking sensor software employs a camera to capture clear images of the car's license plate. The captured number is meticulously verified through a secure database containing essential information. The vehicle is then granted or denied access based on the results of this verification process. This sophisticated system is developed using a combination of Python and C++ programming languages.
